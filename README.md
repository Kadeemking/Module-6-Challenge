# My Weather Dashboard

## Description

I am tasked with creating a website that displays the weather of a city that the user searches for. I was able to use the open weather API and apply it to functions in order to receive the latest weather status as well as the 5 day future forecast. With this project I developed a better understanding on how to utilize APIs in my code, how to save and retrieve data stored in local storage, and how to use Bootstrap.
