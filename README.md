# My Weather Dashboard

## Description

I am tasked with creating an app that displays the weather for the city that the user searches for. I was able to use the open weather api and apply it to a function in order to recieve the latest weather status as well as the 5 day future forecast. Withthis project I developed a better understanding on how to utilize APIs in my code.
